### Building the townhall

Let's play a little and get some materials.

 > Use the browser of _Martel_.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 <!-- CHEAT _Martel_ picks _1_ _material_ card of _wood_ at square _0_ -->
 <!-- CHEAT _Martel_ picks _1_ _material_ card of _hay_ at square _0_ -->
 <!-- Click _Refresh_ in the main header. -->
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _material_ card of _wood_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _material_ card of _hay_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand an _event_ card of _grain_.
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _grain_.

But we have no townhall:

 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _building_ cards.

If you have to build that building you have to play the construction
materials into the building pile.

 > _Martel_ plays 1 _hay_ and 1 _wood_ _material_ cards into the _build_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _building_ card of _townhall_.

And there it is in your hand.

### Playing the townhall

Just play the townhall into any square pile and it will be placed on that square.

 > _Martel_ plays _1_ _building_ card of _townhall_ into his square _1_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
