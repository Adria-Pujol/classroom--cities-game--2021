# Armoury

Every city needs a good army to attack others, and to defend themselves! The Armoury is necessary to train some citizens and turn them into fearsome warriors.

## Playing game

### We need to create a game and join

Create and start playing one of your games:

 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
* Click on the "arnau" city.

### Gather the necessary resources

  <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
