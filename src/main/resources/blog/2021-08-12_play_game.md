## Joining game

### You need another game

Before joining, you need your friend to
create a new game.

 > Given there is your player,  
 > And there is the player "penny",    
 > And "penny" has created the game "together".    
 > And you have been logged in.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  

### Listing your friend games

If you know your friends name, you can see their games.

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "penny" as friend name.  
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  

 > You should be at the list games screen.        
 > There should be 1 game.  
 > You should see the game "together" and creator "penny".  

### Joining the game

To join a game just click on the game name.

 > Join on the game "together" and creator "penny".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > You should see a message saying that "You have joined together game from penny successfully".  

### See you joined games

You can see all your games that are you playing.

 > Go to my playing games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 1 game.  
 > You should see the game "together" and creator "penny".    

### Your games are also in the joined games

If you create a game...

 > Given you have created the game "alone"...   

... you also see this game in the game list.

 > Go to my playing games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 2 games.  
 > You should see the game "together" and creator "penny".  
 > You should see the game "alone" and creator "leonard".  

## Already joined games

### Starting the game

You can see if you have been already joined to any game.

 > Given there is your player,    
 > And there is the player "penny",    
 > And "penny" has created the game "first".    
 > And "penny" has created the game "second".   
 > And you have been logged in.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  

### List friend games

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "penny" as friend name.    
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 2 games.    
 > You should see the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 > You should see the game "second" and creator "penny".  

### Join to the "first" game

 > Join on the game "first" and creator "penny".    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > You should see a message saying that "You have joined first game from penny successfully".    

### And go back to friend games list

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "penny" as friend name.   
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 2 games.    
 > You should see the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 > You should see the game "second" and creator "penny".  
 > You should have joined the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 > You should have not joined the game "second" and creator "penny".  

## Validations

Once again, we are human, so few checks are welcome.

 > Given there is your player,    
 > And you have created the game "mygame".  
 > And there is the player "sheldon",   
 > And there is the player "penny",    
 > And "penny" has created the game "first".      
 > And "penny" has created the game "second".

 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->    

### Empty friend

You must write the friend name.

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "" as friend name.  
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->  
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > You should see an error message saying that "The friend name should be present".  

### Friend should exist

If the friend does not exist, you cannot see their games.

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "unexisting" as friend name.  
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->  
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > You should see an error message saying that "The friend name should be an existing player".  

### Friend with no games

That it is not an error, but you have an empty list.

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "sheldon" as friend name.  
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be no games.  

### You cannot join your games

You have automatically joined to your games, so you cannot join twice.

 > Return from the list games.    
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "leonard" as friend name.  
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 1 game.    
 > You should see the game "mygame" and creator "leonard".  
 > You should have joined the game "mygame" and creator "leonard".  
 > Join on the game "mygame" and creator "leonard".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->  
 > You should see an error message saying that "You should join games in which are you not joined".  
 > There should be 1 game.    
 > You should see the game "mygame" and creator "leonard".  
 > You should have joined the game "mygame" and creator "leonard".  

### And you cannot join twice the same game

If you join to another game...

 > Return from the list games.    
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "penny" as friend name.     
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > There should be 2 games.    
 > You should see the game "first" and creator "penny".   
 > You should see the game "second" and creator "penny".  
 > You should have not joined the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 > You should have not joined the game "second" and creator "penny".  
 > Join on the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > You should see a message saying that "You have joined first game from penny successfully".  

But, you cannot join again:

 > You should be at the player screen.        
 > Enter "penny" as friend name.     
 > Go to friend games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->    
 > There should be 2 games.    
 > You should see the game "first" and creator "penny".     
 > You should see the game "second" and creator "penny".   
 > You should have joined the game "first" and creator "penny".    
 > You should have not joined the game "second" and creator "penny".   
 > Join on the game "first" and creator "penny".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->  
 > You should see an error message saying that "You should join games in which are you not joined".  
 > There should be 2 games.    
 > You should see the game "first" and creator "penny".     
 > You should see the game "second" and creator "penny".   
 > You should have joined the game "first" and creator "penny".    
 > You should have not joined the game "second" and creator "penny".
