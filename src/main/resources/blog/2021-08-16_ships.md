# Ships

Imagine a city in front of the sea,
with a nice ship docked.

Will you board?

 * The load/unload amount should be 0.
 * The load button should be normal.

 * Enter 5 as load/unload amount.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

But it is not loaded, yet, not until the end of the round.

 * The population should be 0.
 * The load/unload amount should be 5.

And the order persist, even if we refresh.

 * The load/unload amount should be 5.
 * The load button should be highlighted.
 * The unload button should be normal.

### The next round

Running the next round will do the load/unload.

 * End the round.
   PRINT LAST SNAPSHOT
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 6.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".

### Exceeding city load

You cannot load more people than population on the city.

 * Enter 9999 as load/unload amount.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

But you can only load at most the population that you had on the city.

 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 1.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".

### Exceeding ship capacity

Skip few turns to wait for population.

 * Skip 8 rounds.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 9.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 12.

And load as many people as you can:

 * Enter 9999 as load/unload amount.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 2.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 20.
 
You cannot load more than 20 people into the ship.

### Exceeding unload capacity

But...

 * Enter 9999 as load/unload amount.
 * Click the unload button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 20.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 0.
 
You loose the population if they do not fit on the city. Sorry.
